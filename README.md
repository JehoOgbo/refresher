# Refresher

Prior to starting this repo, it had been a while since I had written any code. I now will do my best to code everyday as this is the only way to get better.

This repository is to tackle all advanced tasks from the alx course as these test everything in the project and more.
These tasks are not easy and I actually couldn't tackle most of them the first time all those years ago. Now though, I believe I have developed the necessary skills.
However, if you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to contribute.


## alx-low_level_programming

This directory deals with low level algorithms and communication with system components. The language is C and overall helps to develop and test my computational thinking. Note: Some of the tasks are entry level.
