This repository is to tackle all advanced tasks from the alx course as these test everything in the project and more.
These tasks are not easy and I actually couldn't tackle most of them the first time all those years ago. Now though, I believe I have developed the necessary skills.
However, if you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to contribute.

The directory ./alx-low_level_programming/0x02-functions_nested_loops deals with functions and nested loops in C.
