This directory explores the use of nested loops and functions in C.

All files in this directory are to be made with the following requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file


100-times_table.c - File to create a times table for digits from 0 to 15. The file consists of three functions.

The 'main' function in this file is void print_times_table(int n). All function prototypes for functions used across multiple files are used in header.h which is include guarded.
The following constraints are to be observed when coding this tool.

    Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
    If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
    Format: The format is shown below

julien@ubuntu:~/0x02$ cat 100-main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - check the code.
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    print_times_table(3);
    _putchar('\n');
    print_times_table(5);
    _putchar('\n');
    print_times_table(98);
    _putchar('\n');
    print_times_table(12);
    return (0);
}
