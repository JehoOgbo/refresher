# alx-low_level_programming


This directory explores the concepts of low level programming in c. It is part of a project-based learning project and I do my best to write good commit statemets and comments in the code. Not to mention informative READMEs. Enjoy.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This directory explores the use of functions and nested loops in C.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This directory dives deeper into the use of fuctions and nested loops in C.

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory explores the concepts of pointers arrays and strings in C.

## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory dives deeper into the subject of pointers arrays and strings in C. Here we look more closely on array manipulation and use of pointers in C.

## 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory focuses more on using the concepts of arrays, pointers and strings to manipulate memory as well as multi-dimensional arrays in C.

## 0x08-recursion

This directory examines the concept of recursion and it's use from simple to complex tasks

## 0x09-static_libraries

This directory explores the concepts of static libraries in C and how to use them as well as why.

## 0x0A-argc_argv

This directory explores the use of command line arguments in C programs

## 0x0B-malloc_free

This directory explores introductory concepts into dynamic memory allocation in C.

## 0x0C-more_malloc_free

This directory explores further concepts in dynamic memory allocation exploring the working of functions such as calloc and realloc. Here, we also take a deep dive into functions like exit from the exec family.

## 0x0D-preprocessor

This directory explores the concepts of macros and the way the preprocessor handles them buttressing the fact that they should be avoided and the need for include guards in header files.

## 0x0E-structures_typedef

This directory explores the use of structures (structs) to create more powerful data types and using typedef to eliminate the need to constantly type struct whenever the datatype is being used

## 0x0F-function_pointers

This directory explores the concept of pointers to a function in C and how to use them.

## 0x10-variadic_functions

This directory explores the concept of variadic functionns in C and how to use them. These are functions that take a variable number of arguments.

## 0x12-singly_linked_lists

An introduction to linked lists and data structures. In particular singly linked lists.
