# alx-low_level_programming


This directory explores the concepts of low level programming in c. It is part of a project-based learning project and I do my best to write good commit statemets and comments in the code. Not to mention informative READMEs. Enjoy.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This directory explores the use of functions and nested loops in C.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This directory dives deeper into the use of fuctions and nested loops in C.

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory explores the concepts of pointers arrays and strings in C.

## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory dives deeper into the subject of pointers arrays and strings in C. Here we look more closely on array manipulation and use of pointers in C.

## 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory focuses more on using the concepts of arrays, pointers and strings to manipulate memory as well as multi-dimensional arrays in C.

## 0x08-recursion

This directory examines the concept of recursion and it's use from simple to complex tasks

## 0x09-static_libraries

This directory explores the concepts of static libraries in C and how to use them as well as why.

## 0x0A-argc_argv

This directory explores the use of command line arguments in C programs

## 0x0B-malloc_free

This directory explores introductory concepts into dynamic memory allocation in C.

## 0x0C-more_malloc_free

This directory explores further concepts in dynamic memory allocation exploring the working of functions such as calloc and realloc. Here, we also take a deep dive into functions like exit from the exec family.
